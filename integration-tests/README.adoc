= Cassandra Quarkus - Integration tests

This module hosts integration tests for the Cassandra Quarkus extension.

== Running integration tests

To run the non-native integration tests simply execute:

    mvn clean verify
    
To also run integration tests that require a native image to be built, you need to activate the 
`native` profile:

    mvn clean verify -Pnative
    
Native tests require that you point the environment variable `GRAALVM_HOME` to a valid Graal 
installation root. When native integration tests are activated, the build takes considerably longer 
to finish.
