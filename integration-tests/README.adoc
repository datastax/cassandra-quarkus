= Cassandra Quarkus - Integration tests

This module hosts integration tests for the Cassandra Quarkus extension.

It contains the following modules:

1. application: the application classes (no tests);
2. default: the main suite of integration tests;
3. metrics-microprofile: specific tests for metrics with MicroProfile;
4. metrics-disabled: specific tests for disabled metrics.

== Running integration tests

To run the integration tests with regular packaging, simply execute:

    mvn clean verify
    
To run the integration tests in native mode:

    mvn clean verify -Dnative
    
Native mode requires that you point the environment variable `GRAALVM_HOME` to a valid GraalVM
installation root; also, Graal's `native-image` executable must have been previously installed with
`gu install native-image`.

When native mode is on, the build takes considerably longer to finish.
