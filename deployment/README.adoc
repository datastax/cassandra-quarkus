= Cassandra Quarkus - Deployment Module

The Deployment module for an Apache Cassandra(R) extension for Quarkus.

== The Purpose of Deployment

This module contains classes that are used during the build time of this extension.

== The Build Process

The `CassandraClientProcessor` is responsible for producing the `CassandraClientBuildItem`. 
It does the construction of the underlying `QuarkusCqlSession` and injects it into the DI Arc container.

== Deployment Configuration

The `CassandraClientBuildTimeConfig` provides the build time settings for configuration of the `CassandraClientBuildItem`
produced by the `CassandraClientProcessor`. For more information see the java-docs of `CassandraClientBuildTimeConfig`.
