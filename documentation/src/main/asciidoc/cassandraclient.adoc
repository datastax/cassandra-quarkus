= Quarkus - Using the Cassandra Client

Apache CassandraÂ® is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed
to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

In this guide, we will see how you can get your REST services to use a Cassandra database.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* GraalVM installed with `GRAALVM_HOME` configured appropriately if you want to use the native mode.
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* Cassandra or Docker installed

== Architecture

The application built in this guide is quite simple: the user can add elements in a list using a form and the list is updated.

All the information between the browser and the server is formatted as JSON.

The elements are stored in the Cassandra database.


== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

The solution is located in the `quickstart` {quickstart-clone-url}[directory].

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new maven project and copy the `pom.xml` file that is present in the `quickstart` directory.

The `pom.xml` is importing the RESTEasy/JAX-RS, JSON-B, Context Propagation and Cassandra Client extensions.
We will be building a REST application using the {mapper-docs-url}[DataStax Object Mapper].
It will simplify the Data Access Layer code.

The most important part of the `pom.xml` is adding the `cassandra-quarkus` extension:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>cassandra-quarkus-client</artifactId>
  <version>${quarkus.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Creating JSON REST service
In this example, we will create an application to manage a list of fruits.

First, let's create the `Fruit` bean as follows:
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Fruit {

  @ClusteringColumn private String name;
  private String description;
  @PartitionKey private String id;

  public Fruit() {}

  public Fruit(String name, String description, String id) {
    this.name = name;
    this.description = description;
    this.id = id;
  }
  // getters, setters, hashCode and equals omitted for brevity
}
----
We are using DataStax Java driver Object Mapper, which is why this class is annotated with an `@Entity`.
Also, the id field represents a Cassandra partition key and name represents a clustering column so we are using the corresponding annotations
from the Object Mapper library. It will allow the Mapper to generate proper CQL queries underneath.

One important thing to note is that having a default constructor is required by the Object Mapper.

To leverage the Mapper logic in this app we need to create a DAO:
[source,java]
----
@Dao
public interface FruitDao {
  @Update
  void update(Fruit fruit);

  @Select
  PagingIterable<Fruit> findById(String id);
}
----

This class exposes operations that will be used in the REST service.

Finally, the Mapper itself:
[source,java]
----
@Mapper
public interface FruitMapper {
  @DaoFactory
  FruitDao fruitDao(@DaoKeyspace CqlIdentifier keyspace);
}
----
The mapper is responsible for constructing instances of `FruitDao`.

The `FruitDao` should be created for a specific keyspace. We should make it parameterized by using the Quarkus `@ConfigProperties` mechanism.
Firstly, let's define the `FruitServiceConfig` class that will contain the keyspace setting:
[source,java]
----

@ConfigProperties(prefix = "fruit.dao")
public class FruitServiceConfig {
  /** Keyspace that should be used when creating a fruit dao. */
  String keyspace;

  // getter and setter omitted for brevity
}
----
When starting the Quarkus app, it will try to fetch the `fruit.dao.keyspace` setting from the `application.properties` file.
To make it work, we need to add this setting to the `application.properties` file:
[source, properties]
----
fruit.dao.keyspace=k1
----

The instance of a `FruitMapper` should be shared between services that are using it within an application.
We should leverage Quarkus Dependency Injection container and inject the instance of constructed `FruitMapper`:
[source, java]
----
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;

public class FruitMapperProducer {
  private final CqlSession cqlSession;

  @Inject
  public FruitMapperProducer(CqlSession cqlSession) {
    this.cqlSession = cqlSession;
  }

  @Produces
  @ApplicationScoped
  FruitMapper produceFruitMapper() {
    return new FruitMapperBuilder(cqlSession).build();
  }
}
----
Please note the `CqlSession` instance injected automatically by the cassandra-quarkus extension in the `FruitMapperProducer` constructor.
The `produceFruitMapper()` method is constructing `FruitMapper` that will be injected into the Di container by the Quarkus framework.

Now create a `FruitService` that will be the business layer of our application and store/load the fruits from the Cassandra database.
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class FruitService {
  private final FruitDao dao;

  @Inject
  public FruitService(FruitMapper fruitMapper, FruitServiceConfig fruitServiceConfig) {
    dao = fruitMapper.fruitDao(CqlIdentifier.fromCql(fruitServiceConfig.keyspace));
  }

  public void save(Fruit fruit) {
    dao.update(fruit);
  }

  public List<Fruit> get(String id) {
    return dao.findById(id).all();
  }
}
----
Please note the construction of `FruitDao` instance in the constructor. It uses a `FruitMapper` instance injected automatically by the `FruitMapperProducer`.
It is also using the injected `FruitServiceConfig` with the keyspace provided via the `application.properties` file.

The last missing piece is the REST API that will expose GET and POST methods:
[source,java]
----
@Path("/fruits")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class FruitResource {

  private static final String STORE_NAME = "acme";
  @Inject FruitService fruitService;

  @GET
  public List<FruitDto> list() {
    return fruitService.get(STORE_NAME).stream()
        .map(fruit -> new FruitDto(fruit.getName(), fruit.getDescription()))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  @POST
  public void add(FruitDto fruit) {
    fruitService.save(covertFromDto(fruit));
  }

  private Fruit covertFromDto(FruitDto fruitDto) {
    return new Fruit(fruitDto.getName(), fruitDto.getDescription(), STORE_NAME);
  }
}
----

The `list` and `add` operations are executed for the `STORE_NAME` id. This is a partition key of the data model.
We can easily retrieve all rows from cassandra using the partition key. They will be sorted by the clustering key.
`FruitResource` is using `FruitService` which encapsulates the data access logic.

When creating the REST API we should not share the same entity object between REST API and data access layers.
They should not be coupled to allow the API to evolve independently of the storage layer.
This is the reason why the API is using a `FruitDto` class.
This class will be used by Quarkus to convert JSON to java object for client request and java object to JSON for the response.
The translation is done by quarkus-resteasy extension.
[source,java]
----
public class FruitDto {

  private String name;
  private String description;

  public FruitDto() {}

  public FruitDto(String name, String description) {
    this.name = name;
    this.description = description;
  }
  // getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
----

One important thing to note is that having a default constructor is required by the JSON serialization layer.

== Configuring the Cassandra database
The main two properties to configure are `contact-points`, to access the Cassandra database, and `local-datacenter`, which is required by the driver.

A sample configuration should look like this:

[source,properties]
----
# configure the Cassandra client for a replica set of two nodes
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points={cassandra_ip}:9042
quarkus.cassandra.load-balancing-policy.local-datacenter={dc_name}
----

In this example, we are using a single instance running on localhost:

[source,properties]
----
# configure the Cassandra client for a single instance on localhost
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points=127.0.0.1:9042
quarkus.cassandra.load-balancing-policy.local-datacenter=datacenter1
----

You can configure all Java driver settings using `application.conf` or `application.json` files.
They need to be located in the resources directory of your application.
They will be passed automatically to the underlying driver configuration mechanism.
Settings defined in `application.properties` with the `quarkus.cassandra` prefix will have priority over settings defined in `application.conf` or `application.json`.

To see the full list of settings, please refer to the {reference-conf-url}[reference.conf].

== Running a Cassandra Database
By default, `CassandraClient` is configured to access a local Cassandra database on port 9042 (the default Cassandra port).
If you have a local running database on this port, you should assert that:
`quarkus.cassandra.load-balancing-policy.local-datacenter` setting is equal to the datacenter of your local Cassandra instance.
This value can be found with `SELECT data_center FROM system.local` query.

If you want to use Docker to run a Cassandra database, you can use the following command to launch one:
[source,shell]
----
docker run \
   --name local-cassandra-instance \
   -p 7000:7000 \
   -p 7001:7001 \
   -p 7199:7199 \
   -p 9042:9042 \
   -p 9160:9160 \
   -p 9404:9404 \
   -d \
   launcher.gcr.io/google/cassandra3
----
Note that only the 9042 port is required. All others all optional but provide enhanced features like JMX monitoring of the Cassandra instance.

Next you need to create the keyspace and table that will be used by your application:
[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS k1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}"
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS k1.fruit(id text, name text, description text, PRIMARY KEY((id), name))"
----

If you're running Cassandra locally you can execute the cqlsh commands directly:
[source,shell]
----
cqlsh -e "CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS k1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}
cqlsh -e "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS k1.fruit(id text, name text, description text, PRIMARY KEY((id), name))
----

== Creating a frontend

Now let's add a simple web page to interact with our `FruitResource`.
Quarkus automatically serves static resources located under the `META-INF/resources` directory.
In the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` directory, add a `fruits.html` file with the content from this {fruits-html-url}[fruits.html] file in it.

You can now interact with your REST service:

* start Quarkus with `mvn clean quarkus:dev`
* open a browser to `http://localhost:8080/fruits.html`
* add new fruits to the list via the form

== Connection Health Check

If you are using the `quarkus-smallrye-health` extension, `cassandra-quarkus` will automatically add a readiness health check
to validate the connection to the cluster.

So when you access the `/health/ready` endpoint of your application you will have information about the connection validation status.

This behavior can be disabled by setting the `quarkus.cassandra.health.enabled` property to `false` in your `application.properties`.

== Metrics

If you are using the `quarkus-smallrye-metrics` extension, `cassandra-quarkus` can provide metrics about CqlSession and Cassandra nodes.
This behavior must first be enabled by setting the `quarkus.cassandra.metrics.enabled` property to `true` in your `application.properties`.

The next step that you need to do is set explicitly which metrics should be enabled.
The `quarkus.cassandra.metrics.session-enabled` and `quarkus.cassandra.metrics.node-enabled` properties should be used for enabling metrics; the former should contain a list of session-level metrics to enable, while the latter should contain a list of node-level metrics to enable. Both properties accept a comma-separated list of valid metric names.
So for example to enable `session.connected-nodes`, `session.bytes-sent`, and `node.pool.open-connections` you should add the following settings to your
`application.properties`:
[source, properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.enabled=true
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.session-enabled=connected-nodes,bytes-sent
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.node-enabled=pool.open-connections
----

For the full list of available metrics, please refer to the {reference-conf-url}[reference.conf] and the `advanced.metrics` section.

When metrics are properly enabled and when you access the `/metrics` endpoint of your application, you will see metric reports for all enabled metrics.

== Building a native executable

You can use the Cassandra client in a native executable.

You can build a native executable with the `mvn clean package -Pnative` command.

Running it is as simple as executing `./target/quickstart-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

You can then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/fruits.html` and use your application.

== Conclusion

Accessing a Cassandra database from a client application is easy with Quarkus and the Cassandra extension, which provides configuration and native support for the DataStax Java driver for Apache Cassandra.
