= Quarkus demo: Cassandra Client

This example showcases how to use the Cassandra client with Quarkus.

TIP: Detailed instructions about how to build and run this demo can be found in the
link:https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-quarkus/blob/master/documentation/src/main/asciidoc/cassandra.adoc[Quickstart guide].

== Cassandra instance - Running with Docker

Just run it as follows (only 9042 port is required for quickstart application):

[source,shell]
----
docker run --name local-cassandra-instance cassandra
----

**Provision table**

[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS k1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}"
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS k1.fruit(store_id text, name text, description text, PRIMARY KEY(store_id, name))"
----

== Run the demo on dev mode

In the quickstart module root directory:

- Run `mvn clean package` and then `java -jar ./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner.jar`
- In dev mode `mvn clean quarkus:dev`

Go to `http://localhost:8080/fruits.html`, it should show a simple App to manage list of Fruits. 
You can add fruits to the list via the form.

Alternatively, you can use curl commands to interact with the underlying REST API.
To create a fruit:

[source,shell]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name":"curl_product","description":"this was created via curl"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/fruits
----

To retrieve fruits:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/fruits
----

== Using the reactive endpoints

This application provides a reactive version of REST controllers. 
To see how they work, go to `http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html`
You can add fruits to the list via the form. This time the logic will be executed in a reactive way. 

Alternatively, you can use curl commands to interact with the underlying REST API.
To create fruit in an async way:

[source,shell]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name":"async_product","description":"this was created via curl"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits
----

To retrieve fruits:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits
----

== Running in native mode

You can compile the application into a native binary using:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package -Dnative
----

Then run it with:

[source,shell]
----
./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----
