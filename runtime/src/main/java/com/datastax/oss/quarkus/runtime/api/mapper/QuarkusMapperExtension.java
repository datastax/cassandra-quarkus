/**
 * Companion annotation to the driver's {@link com.datastax.oss.driver.api.mapper.annotations.Mapper
 * Mapper} annotation. It allows to customize Quarkus-specific features when generating code for a
 * Mapper-annotated interface.
 *
 * <p>Currently only one attribute is supported: {@link #generateProducers()}. When the annotation
 * is absent, or when it is present and the attribute is true (the default), bean producers will be
 * generated for the annotated Mapper interface itself, and for all of the DAO factory methods
 * declared in it, except those taking arguments. This makes it possible to inject such beans
 * automatically. When the attribute is false, the mapper annotation processor will skip the
 * generation of bean producers completely, and injection of such beans has to be done manually.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Mapper
 * &#64;QuarkusMapperExtension(generateProducers=false)
 * public interface InventoryMapper {
 *   &#64;DaoFactory
 *   ProductDao productDao();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The mapper annotation processor would still generate an implementation and a builder for the
 * above interface, but no bean producer would be generated.
